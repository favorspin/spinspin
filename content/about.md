I've been curious my whole life. Driven by a need to know, I've found myself bouncing off the walls of new hobbies and interests like a pinball finding it's staggered path through the bumpers. From software development to Ham Radio, poetry to photography - I've spent a great majority of my life learning anything that sparked my inquisitive mind. And it's that same curiosity that has guided the path through my career.

<img src="/images/scissor_kick.jpg" style="float:left;padding:10px;width:400px;">Early on, I thought I’d end up in the music business. I grew up in and around recording studios and concert stages, playing in bands or running cables - naturally, I was certain of the path I was on. And for a while that was my reality. After high-school and a stint in the military, I moved to Florida, went to college, and ran a recording studio. But what started as fun, quickly turned sour as I, increasingly, had to make the choice to work with projects that could pay the rent over working with musicians I enjoyed the most. It wasn’t all bad though, and the business was fairly successful. But the experience taught me a lot about passion, and what it means when someone says "do what you love." 

After a few years, I decided I needed a change. So I sold everything, and made the somewhat ironic move to Austin to escape the music industry. Changing careers can be difficult, especially without a clear goal in mind, but Austin afforded me some opportunities that I was lucky enough to be able to embrace. I was delivering pizzas when a small start up called Favor launched, and figured I’d give it a shot. I started as a driver, but as is the course of many successful startups, Favor was growing fast. Within a couple of months we had doubled and re-doubled our customer and driver base. During that time, and because of my logistics background in the military, I was brought on as the company’s first employee to write a training manual, SOPs, and hire and manage new drivers for the company.

I spent the next few years growing with the company and jumping on new opportunities as they were offered. I travelled across the country launching Favor in several different cities and hiring teams there to handle the business after I left. Along the way I cut my teeth on analytics and SQL, providing myself and the company with the metrics necessary to ensure we were successful in our expansion endeavors. But once again, I knew I was on the cusp of something big and it was time for a change.

<img src="/images/selfie.jpg" style="float:right;padding:10px;width:200px;">Upon returning from my seventh launch, I was sure that my experience and tribal knowledge would be even more effective if I could concentrate on our company’s data platform and analytics. After being handed an ultimatum that I would need to prove myself in the new role, I was given the opportunity to become Favor’s first Data Analyst.

For five years following my move to the Data world, I would build the company’s entire data platform from the ground up. Our ETL process, cloud analytics infrastructure, and reporting platform along with the metrics that ensured the company’s success was built in whole or in part by me. 

Since then, I have found myself in other data roles, building new technologies and pipelines and further refining my skills as a Data Engineer and Architect. In doing so, I also figured out what people mean when they say "do what you love."

And I *love* data.
